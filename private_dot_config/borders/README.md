# JankyBorders

[JankyBorders](https://github.com/FelixKratz/JankyBorders) is a lightweight utility that draws colored borders around windows on macOS, making it easy to see which window is active. It is especially useful with tiling window managers like yabai or AeroSpace where windows sit edge-to-edge.
