# Zathura

[Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) is a lightweight, keyboard-driven PDF and document viewer with vim-like navigation. It supports PDF, DJVU, PostScript, and Comic Book formats.

## Prerequisites

- [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) and a document plugin (e.g. `zathura-pdf-mupdf`)

## Overview

Configuration is minimal -- the only customization is enabling clipboard support so that selected text is copied to the system clipboard.
