# Yazi

[Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) is a blazing-fast terminal file manager written in Rust with image preview support, vim-like keybindings, and a plugin system. It serves as a modern alternative to `ranger`.

## Prerequisites

- [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/installation)

## Overview

The configuration here is minimal -- defaults are used for both `yazi.toml` (general settings) and `keymap.toml` (keybindings). The **Catppuccin Mocha Blue** theme is downloaded automatically by chezmoi (see `.chezmoiexternal.toml`).
