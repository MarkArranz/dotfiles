# Qt6ct

[Qt6ct](https://github.com/trialuser02/qt6ct) is a configuration tool for Qt 6 application appearance on non-KDE desktops. Without it, Qt apps may look out of place on Hyprland or other non-Qt desktop environments.

## Prerequisites

- [qt6ct](https://github.com/trialuser02/qt6ct)
- Set the environment variable `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct` (e.g. in your shell profile or Hyprland config)

## Overview

Used here to apply the **Catppuccin Frappe Flamingo** color scheme to all Qt 6 applications so they match the rest of the desktop. The theme file is downloaded automatically by chezmoi (see `.chezmoiexternal.toml`).
